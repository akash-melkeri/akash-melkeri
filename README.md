QnA

John Doe : "Hey Akash, How come you have these many projects, But not matching number of commits?"

Akash : "I used to think that github is just for uploading projects. So I used to create projects and upload whole project in single commit-push. There is A plausible reason for me thinking that way. When I first started using github, I had no mentor to show me things like this. So..."

John Doe : "I noticed that you have only website projects and scripts. So are you a web developer?"

Akash : "ABSOLUTELY NOT! I like to code everything. what matters is just the idea and concept (compensation too)."

John Doe : "Then why haven't you uploaded any of projects other than web development?"

Akash : "Actually I have them in my github. But they are private. Because I am still working on them. Still have not made any showable progress."

John Doe : "Just out curiosity, can you ellaborate on these projects?"

Akash : "Why not! I have many types of projects. I have scripts for web scraping, Automation,etc. For android development, I am working on music app. There are many other projects as well. But it won't be feasible for a reader to read about them here in readme.md. So I am also working on a portfolio website for me. I will be showcasing my projects there."

That's it . If you have other questions, you can contact me.
